      <h1>Delivery 2: Data Cleansing</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <br/>
      
      <h3>1. Handling Missing Values:</h3>
      <p> Missing values were addressed depending on the data type:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For numeric columns (e.g., stock prices, VIX, S&P 500), rows with missing values were dropped.</li>
        <li>For macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP, CPI), forward filling was applied to propagate previous values where gaps existed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Standardizing Data Formats:</h3>
      <p>The date column was standardized as a datetime index for all datasets. This allowed seamless integration during the merging step. Additionally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Volume data in stock datasets was normalized by dividing it into millions for better scaling.</li>
        <li>CPI column was renamed to "CPI" for uniformity.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Outlier Handling:</h3>
      <p>
          Given that we are working with stock-related data, extreme values often represent genuine market 
          conditions rather than errors. Preserving these factual values is critical for accurately modeling stock behavior and trends.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Consistency in Employee Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Employee data was adjusted to align with fiscal year conventions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dates for employee records were shifted to represent the start of the fiscal year.</li>
        <li>Employee data was aggregated to yearly frequency, consistent with its role as a key feature.</li>
      </ul>
